1. Sentence code errors are expressed decievingly. Instead of x "is a valid sentence code," it should say x "is not a valid sentence code."
2. The code for sentence 4 (send money) should check that the amount is positive, as sending negative money does not makes sense. It should print out "ERROR" at the end of the sentence.
3. Sentence 4 is gramatically incorrect. Should be "I have to buy another book for one of my classes," not books.
4. When the integer sequence "5 2" is entered, there is no period.
5. when 2 4 is entered, the program should say "The weather here has been cold," not "The weather here has been hot."
6. When 3 3 is entered, the program's output should read "I plan to come home for visit next weekend," not "I plan to come home for a visit last weekend."
7. When an invalid sentence code is used for sentence 5, the output reads "Thanks for the ERROR," but it should read "Thanks for the ERROR you sent."
